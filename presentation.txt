Every city is built on different circumstances, environment and different constraints. I am going to compare the neighborhoods of of 2 major columns and how can they be compared with respect to places to eat, better connectivity to several useful regions and how are they distributed around both cities. The places I will be considering are airports, metro, coffee shop, restaurants, schools, college, general stores, hospitals etc. The audience will be tourists who consider travelling through financial capital of the 2 countries analyzed and search for better neighborhoods suited for their needs.
