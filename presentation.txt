London is a great city. It is diverse, multicultural and full of opportunities. But there is also another
side to its popularity and appeal. London is an expensive place to live and thrive. Many businesses
want to open a venue here and many pay top price to have their window on Piccadilly or Oxford
Street. With such a competitive market and high revenues (London GDP accounts for 25% of the
whole country`s) it is challenging for newcomers to find a great place to make their first steps and
competition if fiercer than ever. In this situation, there is no such thing as too much data to help
make that choice.
Problem
But what about those, who want to start their own business and cannot really afford to open in the
City yet? Where is it best to open a new place? Where will it be cheapest and will have enough
people living around to be popular? Where the competition is not too overwhelming?
If we consider all of these questions, it might be a good idea to turn to data on the outer London
boroughs, to look into the numbers with a bit more scrutiny.
Interest
The analysis will be of interest to the following groups:
1. First time entrepreneurs, who want to start their first business. Below dataset will give a
comprehensive insight into where best to open a new venue, to maximise the value for
money.
2. People who already run a business and want to branch out. Given the extra information,
it may provide valuable information before decision making.
